# plotter-text

Generate dynamic single-stroke text in Processing. Save to SVG for clean pen plotter output.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

1. [Processing 4](https://processing.org/download/)

### Installation

#### Copy the PlotterText Class to Your Project

Copy the `PlotterText.pde` file from the `dist` folder into the folder for your Processing sketch.

#### Copy the Font Files (or Create Your Own)

Copy the entire [`astroTown`](/fonts/astroTown/) font folder into your sketch's `data` folder.

If you want to create your own font, you'll need an SVG file for each character and a `data.json` file to specify font coordinates. Use the [Font Editor](examples/FontEditor/) in the `examples` folder to edit character positions and kerning pairs.

### Example Sketch

1. Create an instance of the `PlotterText` class with the path to your font.
2. Use `drawText()` or `drawTextCentered()` to render text to the screen.

```java
PlotterText pt;

void setup() {
  size(300, 200);
  pt = new PlotterText("astroTown/", 20);
}

void draw() {
  background(255);
  pt.drawText("Hello world!", 10, 10);
}

```

## Usage

### Instantiation

_PlotterText_ **new PlotterText**( _String_ fontPath, [ _float_ size ] )

Create an instance of the PlotterText class.  
`fontPath` specifies the location of your font's folder (relative to your sketch's `data` folder).
`size` is the desired display size in pixels.

### Drawing Text

_void_ **drawText**( _String_ text, [ _float_ x, _float_ y ] )

Draw text to the screen.  
`x` and `y` specify the position of the top left of the text.

_void_ **drawTextCentered**( _String_ text, [ _float_ x, _float_ y ] )

Draw text to the screen, horizontally centered.
`x` and `y` specify the position of the top center of the text.

### Font Properties

_float_ **letterSpacing**

The amount of additional space to add between each letter.  
Expressed as a percentage of the character size.

_float_ **lineHeight**

The amount of vertical space given to each line in multiline text.  
Expressed as a percentage of the character size.

_float_ **spaceWidth**

The width of a space character.  
Expressed as a percentage of the character size.

_void_ **setSize**( _float_ size )

Set the display height of your font. Change this in between calls to `drawText` to create text of different sizes.

### Utility

_float_ **getStringWidth**( _String_ text )

Calculate the width of a string using your font at its current size without drawing to the screen.

### Modify and Save

Additional methods are available to modify font data and save it to disk.  
Check [PlotterText.pde](src/PlotterText.pde) for details.

## Saving to SVG

## Build from Source

The build script for this project (`build.sh`) simply copies the classes from `src` into a single file in the `dist` folder.

```zsh
cd [plotter-text]
./build.sh
```
